\arguments{
\item{tibble}{(tibble) Object returned by the function textTrainN.}

\item{sample_percents}{(numeric) Vector containing the percents of the total number of datapoints that is
included in each sample (default = c(25,50,75,100)).}

\item{n_cross_val}{(numeric) Value of the number of times cross-validation has been repeated (default = 1,
i.e., cross-validation has only been applied once).}

\item{x_unit}{(character, "percent" or "quantity") Determines whether the x-axis-values should represent the number of elements in each sample,
or the number of percent of the total data they represent (default = "percent").}

\item{y_range}{(numeric) Optional. Determines the y_range. E.g, y_range = c(1,2) sets the y_range from 1 to 2 (default = NULL).}

\item{title}{(character) Determine plot title (default = "Cross-validated correlation coefficients across different sample sizes").}

\item{x_axes_label}{(character) Determine x-axis-label (default = "Sample Size (percent)").}

\item{y_axes_label}{(character) Determine y-axis-label (default = "Correlation Coefficient (r)").}

\item{point_color}{(character, (Hex color codes)) Determine point color (default = "#5dc688").}

\item{bar_color}{(character, (Hex color codes)) Determine error-bar color (default = "#60A1F7").}

\item{line_color}{(character, (Hex color codes)) Determine line color (default = "grey").}

\item{bar_width}{(numeric) Determine bar-width (default = 1).}

\item{bar_size}{(numeric) Determine bar-size (default = 1).}

\item{line_size}{(numeric) Determine line-size (default = 1).}

\item{line_type}{(character, either "straight" or "smooth") Determine line-type (default = "straight").}

\item{point_size}{(numeric) Determine points size (default = 1).}
}
\value{
A plot with correlation coefficient on y-axis and sample size in quantity or percent on x axis.
If number och cross-validations exceed 1, then error bars measuring standard deviations will be plotted.
