## R Language Analysis Suite
An R-package for analyzing natural language with transformers-based large language models. The `text` package is part of the *R Language Analysis Suite*, including:

+ [`talk`](https://www.r-talk.org/) - a package that transforms voice recordings into text, audio features, or embeddings.<br>
<br>
+ [`text`](https://www.r-text.org/) - a package that provides tools for many language tasks such as converting text into word embeddings.<br>
<br>
`talk` and `text` offer access to Large Language Models from Hugging Face.<br>
<br>
+ [`topics`](https://www.r-topics.org/) a package with tools for visualizing language patterns into topics.<br>
 <br>
+ [`the L-BAM Library`](https://r-text.org/articles/LBAM.html) a library that provides pre-trained models for different psychological assessments such as mental health issues, personality and related behaviours.<br>
 <br>

<br>
The *R Language Analysis Suite* is created through a collaboration between psychology and computer science to address research needs and ensure state-of-the-art techniques. The suite is continuously tested on Ubuntu, Mac OS and Windows using the latest stable R version.

The *text*-package has two main objectives:
<br>
* First, to serve R-users as a *point solution* for transforming text to state-of-the-art word embeddings that are ready to be used for downstream tasks. The package provides a user-friendly link to language models based on transformers from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/).
<br>
* Second, to serve as an *end-to-end solution* that provides state-of-the-art AI techniques tailored for social and behavioral scientists.
<br>
Please reference our tutorial article when using the `text` package: [The text-package: An R-package for Analyzing and Visualizing Human Language Using Natural Language Processing and Deep Learning](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37126041/).

### Point solution for converting text to embeddings
Recent significant advances in NLP research have resulted in improved representations of human language (i.e., language models). These language models have produced big performance gains in tasks related to understanding human language. Text are making these SOTA models  easily accessible through an interface to [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/index) in Python.

*Text* provides many of the contemporary state-of-the-art language models that are based on deep learning to model word order and context. Multilingual language models can also represent several languages; multilingual BERT comprises *104 different languages*.

See [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/models/) for a more comprehensive list of models. 



### An end-to-end package
*Text* also provides functions to analyse the word embeddings with well-tested machine learning algorithms and statistics. The focus is to analyze and visualize text, and their relation to other text or numerical variables. For example, the `textTrain()` function is used to examine how well the word embeddings from a text can predict a numeric or categorical variable. Another example is functions plotting statistically significant words in the word embedding space.
