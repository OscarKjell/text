\title{Individually trains word embeddings from several text variables to several numeric or categorical variables.
It is possible to have  word embeddings from one text variable and several numeric/categprical variables;
or vice verse, word embeddings from several text variables to one numeric/categorical variable.
It is not possible to mix numeric and categorical variables.}
\usage{
textTrainLists(
  x,
  y,
  force_train_method = "automatic",
  save_output = "all",
  method_cor = "pearson",
  eval_measure = "rmse",
  p_adjust_method = "holm",
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Word embeddings from textEmbed (or textEmbedLayerAggreation).}

\item{y}{Tibble with several numeric or categorical variables to predict. Please note that you cannot mix numeric and
categorical variables.}

\item{force_train_method}{Default is "automatic"; see also "regression" and "random_forest".}

\item{save_output}{Option not to save all output; default "all". see also "only_results"
and "only_results_predictions".}

\item{method_cor}{A character string describing type of correlation (default "Pearson").}

\item{eval_measure}{Type of evaluative measure to assess models on.}

\item{p_adjust_method}{Method to adjust/correct p-values for multiple comparisons
(default = "holm"; see also "none", "hochberg", "hommel", "bonferroni", "BH", "BY",  "fdr").}

\item{...}{Arguments from textTrainRegression or textTrainRandomForest the textTrain function.}
}
\value{
Correlations between predicted and observed values.
