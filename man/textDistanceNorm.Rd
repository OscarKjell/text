\title{Compute the semantic distance between a text variable and a word norm
(i.e., a text represented by one word embedding that represent a construct/concept).}
\usage{
textDistanceNorm(x, y, method = "euclidean", center = FALSE, scale = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Word embeddings (from textEmbed).}

\item{y}{Word embedding from textEmbed (from only one text).}

\item{method}{(character) Character string describing type of measure to be computed; default is "euclidean" (see also
measures from stats:dist() including "maximum", "manhattan", "canberra", "binary" and "minkowski".
It is also possible to use "cosine", which computes the cosine distance (i.e., 1 - cosine(x, y)).}

\item{center}{(boolean; from base::scale) If center is TRUE then centering is done by subtracting the embedding mean
(omitting NAs) of x from each of its dimension, and if center is FALSE, no centering is done.}

\item{scale}{(boolean; from base::scale) If scale is TRUE then scaling is done by dividing the
(centered) embedding dimensions by the standard deviation of the embedding if center is TRUE,
 and the root mean square otherwise.}
}
\value{
A vector comprising semantic distance scores.
}
\description{
