\title{(experimental) Plot cross-validated correlation coefficients across different sample-sizes from the object
returned by the textTrainN function. If the number of cross-validations exceed one, then
error-bars will be included in the plot.}
\usage{
textTrainNPlot(
  train_data,
  sample_percents = c(25, 50, 75, 100),
  x_unit = "percent",
  y_range = NULL,
  title = "Cross-validated correlation coefficients across different sample sizes",
  x_axes_label = "Sample Size (percent)",
  y_axes_label = "Correlation Coefficient (r)"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{train_data}{(tibble) Object returned by the function textTrainN.}

\item{sample_percents}{(numeric) Vector containing the percents of the total number of datapoints that is
included in each sample (default = c(25,50,75,100)).}

\item{x_unit}{(character, "percent" or "quantity") Determines whether the x-axis-values should represent
the number of elements in each sample, or the number of percent of the total data they represent
(default = "percent").}

\item{y_range}{(numeric) Optional. Determines the y_range. E.g, y_range = c(1,2) sets the y_range from
1 to 2 (default = NULL).}

\item{title}{(character) Determine plot title (default = "Cross-validated correlation coefficients
across different sample sizes").}

\item{x_axes_label}{(character) Determine x-axis-label (default = "Sample Size (percent)").}

\item{y_axes_label}{(character) Determine y-axis-label (default = "Correlation Coefficient (r)").}
