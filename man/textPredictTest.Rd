\title{Significance testing correlations
If only y1 is provided a t-test is computed, between the absolute error from yhat1-y1 and yhat2-y1.}
\usage{
textPredictTest(
  y1,
  y2 = NULL,
  yhat1,
  yhat2,
  paired = TRUE,
  bootstraps_times = 10000,
  seed = 6134,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{y1}{The observed scores (i.e., what was used to predict when training a model).}

\item{y2}{The second observed scores (default = NULL; i.e., for when comparing models that are predicting different
outcomes. In this case a bootstrap procedure is used to create two distributions of correlations that are
compared (see description above).}

\item{yhat1}{The predicted scores from model 1.}

\item{yhat2}{The predicted scores from model 2 that will be compared with model 1.}

\item{paired}{Paired test or not in stats::t.test (default TRUE).}

\item{bootstraps_times}{Number of bootstraps (when providing y2).}

\item{seed}{Set different seed.}

\item{...}{Settings from stats::t.test or overlapping::overlap (e.g., plot = TRUE).}
}
\value{
Comparison of correlations either a t-test or the overlap of a bootstrapped procedure (see $OV).
}
\description{
If y2 is provided a bootstrapped procedure is used to compare the correlations between y1 and yhat1 versus
y2 and yhat2. This is achieved by creating two distributions of correlations using bootstrapping; and then
finally compute the distributions overlap.

\examples{
# Example random data
y1 <- runif(10)
yhat1 <- runif(10)
y2 <- runif(10)
yhat2 <- runif(10)

boot_test <- textPredictTest(y1, yhat1, y2, yhat2, bootstraps_times = 10)
