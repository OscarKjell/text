# text 1.2
## Functions
- `get_bert_topic()` trains a BERTopic model with different modules and returns the model, data, and topic_document distributions based on c-td-idf
# text 1.1
## Functions
- `textEmbed()` is now fully embedding one column at the time; and reducing word_types for each column. This can break some code; and produc different results in plots where word_types and based on several embedded columns.
- `textTrainN()` and `textTrainNPlot()` evaluates prediction accuracy across number of cases. 
- `textTrainRegression()` and `textTrainRandomForest` now takes tibble as input in strata. 


# text 1.0
## Function
- multinomial regression in `textTrainRegression()`
- `textPredictTest()` can handle `auc`
- `textEmbed()` is faster (thanks to faster handling of aggregating layers)
- Added `sort` parameter in `textEmbedRawLayers()`. 

## Bug/unexpected behaviour
- Tests using training with random forest was updated since outcomes changed when updating from R 4.2 to R 4.3.1. (see test_2_textTrain.R in tests/testthat folder)

# text 0.9.99.3

## Functions changes
- Removing `textSimialirtyTest()` for version 1.0 because it needs more evaluations.

- changed in `sorting_xs_and_x_append` from Dim to Dim0 when renaming x_appended variables.
- changed `first` to `append_first` and  made it an option in `textTrainRegression()` and `textTrainRandomForest()`.
