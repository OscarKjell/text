\title{Train word embeddings to a numeric (ridge regression) or categorical (random forest) variable.}
\usage{
textTrain(x, y, force_train_method = "automatic", ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Word embeddings from textEmbed (or textEmbedLayerAggreation).
Can analyze several variables at the same time; but if training to several
outcomes at the same time use a tibble within the list as input rather than just a
tibble input (i.e., keep the name of the wordembedding).}

\item{y}{Numeric variable to predict. Can be several; although then make
sure to have them within a tibble (this is required
even if it is only one outcome but several word embeddings variables).}

\item{force_train_method}{default is "automatic", so if y is a factor
random_forest is used, and if y is numeric ridge regression
is used. This can be overridden using "regression" or "random_forest".}

\item{...}{Arguments from textTrainRegression or textTrainRandomForest
the textTrain function.}
}
\value{
A correlation between predicted and observed values; as well as a
 tibble of predicted values.
